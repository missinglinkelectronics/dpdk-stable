# DPDK PMD driver for the corundum project

This driver was tested with a 10G version of mqnic build for an AMD ZCU106 board. It was attached to a standard intel
NIC (X710 based). Both hosts were running Ubuntu 18.04 with the intel NIC being operated using the standard Linux driver
and the mqnic being operated by this new DPDK PMD.

Using a packet generator like pktgen and tcpdump on the intel NIC side, this driver has been validated, while the mqnic
side was running either the "dpdk-testpmd" or "l2fwd" example applications with no-mac-updating option enabled.

This driver is built against

- DPDK-Stable 21.11 [1] as a base for the DPDK driver
- a specific, partially outdated Corundum/mqnic version [2]
  as the base for the mqnic adapted from the kernel driver
  and for the hardware design

## How to build

### Prerequisites

To prepare a DPDK pmd for usage, the following commands shall be executed. Especially note that hugepages have to be
enabled when using a DPDK pmd.

```shell
sudo ./usertools/dpdk-hugepages.py --setup 2G
sudo modprobe vfio-pci
sudo ./usertools/dpdk-devbind.py -b vfio-pci 0000:06:00.0
```

### Building the DPDK project

The following commands must be executed in the project root directory:

```shell
meson -Dexamples=all build
ninja -C build -j"$(nproc)"
```

## Testing

### l2fwd

The [l2fwd](https://doc.dpdk.org/guides-21.11/sample_app_ug/l2_forward_real_virtual.html) app from the dpdk project
forwards the incomming traffic to the next port as outgoing traffic. This driver was tested with the following command:

```shell
sudo ./build/examples/dpdk-l2fwd -l 0-3 -n 4 -- -p 0x3 --no-mac-updating
```

The output should look similar to the following log:

```
$ sudo ./build/examples/dpdk-l2fwd -l 0-3 -n 4 -- -p 0x3 --no-mac-updating

```

### Testpmd

The [testpmd](https://doc.dpdk.org/guides-21.11/testpmd_app_ug/index.html) application allows the developer to test the
drivers functionality. The application can be launched with the following command:

```shell
sudo ./build/app/dpdk-testpmd
```

The output should look similar to the following log:

```
$ sudo ./build/app/dpdk-testpmd
EAL: Detected 8 lcore(s)
EAL: Detected 1 NUMA nodes
EAL: Detected static linkage of DPDK
